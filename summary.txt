These ethical quandries stumble upon many aspects of both technical and socio-technical systems, calling the morality of certain system structures into question.

A retailer selling your personal information to others for profit is a system that has the whole rather than the parts ideology. It disrupts the interconnection/relationships between the system and the users, causing distrust. The system has dynamic behavior in the sense that whenever they get enough data on users, the system dynamically decides when it has enough data to be appealing to buyers. The system structure innately promotes ill behavior.

Edward Snowden's release of Top Secret information about National Security Administration security and surveillance practices disrupted the interconnections/relationships between him and the U.S. government as well as the relationship between the U.S. government and the American people. The system was both the cause of its behavior and generates its behavior. This is because the system drives the behavior of disregarding privacy to track individual citizens, but also the system is defined by this behavior.

Cambridge Analytica's use of fake social media accounts to influence the 2016 presidential vote in the United States of America was a system based on the idea of the whole rather than the parts. It didn't matter the morality of the different parts of the system as long as the end goal was achieved. This disrupted interconnections/relationships between the American people and Cambridge Analytica. This system had dynamic behavior in the sense that they tracked people's interests and dynamically provided them with political material that was generally false. The system was defined by its behaviors, making people believe that the company was sly and manipulating them.
